The fix worked!\n</thinking>\n\n**Yes, it's working now!**\n\nLook at the progress:\n- ✅ Loop #1 completed successfully\n- ✅ Loop #2 started (Call 2/100)\n- ✅ Session continuity working (resuming same Claude session)\n\nRalph is actively running through the testing checklist. It will keep looping until it completes all the tasks in `@fix_plan.md`.\n\nYou can let it run. Check back in a few minutes - it should be making progress on the testing items and will create a `TESTING_REPORT.md` when done.",
