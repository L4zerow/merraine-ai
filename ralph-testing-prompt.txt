You are testing Merraine AI, a recruiting app built with Next.js. Your job is to do end-to-end user testing from a recruiter's perspective.

START THE APP:
Run `npm run dev` and test at http://localhost:3000

TEST AS A RECRUITER WOULD:

1. DASHBOARD (/)
- Does it load correctly?
- Is it clear what this app does?
- Can I navigate to all sections easily?

2. SEARCH PAGE (/search)
- Try a natural language search like "senior software engineers in San Francisco with React experience"
- Test different search options (Fast vs Pro, insights, scoring, freshness, emails, phones)
- Are the credit costs clear BEFORE I search?
- Do results display properly?
- Does the credit tracker update after searching?

3. JOBS PAGE (/jobs)
- Add a test job with ID "test-senior-dev" and a realistic job description
- Does the cost (1 credit) show clearly?
- Does the job appear in the list after adding?
- Try deleting the job - does it work?

4. MATCHES PAGE (/matches)
- Load the sample profile
- Run a match against indexed jobs
- Are the match scores displayed clearly?
- Is the credit cost clear (1 per match found)?

5. CREDIT SYSTEM (throughout)
- Is it always obvious what actions cost?
- Does the credit tracker in the header update in real-time?
- Are there warnings when credits are low?

ITERATE AND FIX:
- If you find bugs, fix them
- If something is confusing from a recruiter's POV, improve it
- If credit costs aren't clear somewhere, make them clearer
- Test again after each fix

REPORT:
After testing, create a file called TESTING_REPORT.md with:
- What worked well
- Bugs found and fixed
- UX improvements made
- Any remaining issues

Keep iterating until the app feels polished and recruiter-friendly.
